  "ShortSummary": "Immutable holder for username and password with a factory method and getters.",
  "Summary": "Final Credentials class storing username and password as final Strings. Provides a static of(username, password) factory and a constructor annotated with @ConstructorParameters for tooling/bean introspection. Exposes getUsername() and getPassword(); no mutation methods. Note: password is a String, which has typical Java immutability/lifetime caveats.",
  "MostImportantThings": [
    "Final, immutable value object with two final fields: username and password",
    "Static factory method Credentials.of(String, String)",
    "@ConstructorParameters({\"username\", \"password\"}) aids introspection/JMX",
    "Only accessors: getUsername(), getPassword(); no setters",
    "No equals/hashCode/toString implementations provided",
    "Password stored as String (potential security/lifetime consideration)"
  ],
  "RelatedFunctionality": [
    "Used to pass credentials for obtaining JDBC connections (e.g., DataSource.getConnection(username, password)) within HikariCP",
    "Relates to HikariCP configuration where username/password may be specified or overridden per-connection",
    "Annotation supports frameworks/tools (JMX/beans) that map constructor parameters",
    "Likely referenced by utility or pool components when handling per-request credentials (if present)"

  "ShortSummary": "Factory that creates Micrometer-based metrics trackers for HikariCP using a provided MeterRegistry.",
  "Summary": "MicrometerMetricsTrackerFactory implements MetricsTrackerFactory and wires HikariCP pool metrics into Micrometer. It holds a final MeterRegistry and, when asked, creates a MicrometerMetricsTracker for a given pool name and PoolStats, enabling metric registration and reporting via Micrometer.",
  "MostImportantThings": [
    "Implements MetricsTrackerFactory for HikariCP's metrics SPI.",
    "Requires a Micrometer MeterRegistry via constructor; stored as final (thread-safe).",
    "create(poolName, poolStats) returns a new MicrometerMetricsTracker bound to the registry.",
    "Integrates HikariCP pool statistics with Micrometer without additional logic in the factory."

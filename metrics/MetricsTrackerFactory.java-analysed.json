  "ShortSummary": "Factory interface for creating IMetricsTracker instances per connection pool using pool name and PoolStats.",
  "Summary": "Defines a single method, create(poolName, poolStats), to supply an IMetricsTracker for a given HikariCP pool. It decouples metrics integration from the core pool by allowing pluggable tracker implementations.",
  "MostImportantThings": [
    "Implements the factory pattern for metrics trackers.",
    "Method: IMetricsTracker create(String poolName, PoolStats poolStats).",
    "Trackers are instantiated per pool, identified by poolName.",
    "PoolStats is provided to feed metrics data into the tracker.",
    "Used to integrate external metrics systems without coupling to HikariCP internals."

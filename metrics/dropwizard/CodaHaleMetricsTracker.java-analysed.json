{
  "ShortSummary": "Dropwizard (Codahale) metrics tracker for a HikariCP pool that registers timers, histograms, meters, and gauges in a MetricRegistry and cleans them up on close.",
  "Summary": "CodaHaleMetricsTracker integrates HikariCP with Dropwizard Metrics. For a given pool name, it registers: a Timer for connection acquisition wait time (nanos), Histograms for connection usage duration (millis) and connection creation time (millis), a Meter for connection timeouts, and Gauges reflecting PoolStats (total/idle/active/pending/max/min connections). It provides record* methods invoked by HikariCP to update metrics and removes all metrics from the registry when closed.",
  "MostImportantThings": [
    "Registers and names metrics per pool using DropwizardCommon constants and MetricRegistry.name(poolName, ...).",
    "Measures acquisition in nanoseconds (Timer), usage and creation in milliseconds (Histograms), and timeout events via Meter.mark().",
    "Exposes Gauges for PoolStats: total, idle, active, pending threads, max, and min connections.",
    "Implements lifecycle: all metrics are removed from the registry in close() to prevent leaks and name collisions.",
    "Provides getters for underlying Timer/Histograms for external inspection/testing."

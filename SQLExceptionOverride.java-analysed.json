  "ShortSummary": "HikariCP interface allowing users to override how SQLExceptions trigger connection eviction from the pool.",
  "Summary": "SQLExceptionOverride defines a hook called when a JDBC call throws SQLException. Implementations return an Override decision: CONTINUE_EVICT (use HikariCP’s built‑in SQLState/error‑code rules), DO_NOT_EVICT (suppress eviction), or MUST_EVICT (force eviction). The default implementation returns CONTINUE_EVICT.",
  "MostImportantThings": [
    "Purpose: customize connection eviction behavior on SQLException.",
    "Override enum: CONTINUE_EVICT (defer to default), DO_NOT_EVICT (prevent), MUST_EVICT (force).",
    "Default method adjudicate(SQLException) returns CONTINUE_EVICT; override to change behavior.",
    "Decision is evaluated whenever a JDBC method throws SQLException; MUST_EVICT/DO_NOT_EVICT bypass built‑in SQLState/error‑code logic."
  ],
  "RelatedFunctionality": [
    "HikariCP’s default SQLException handling based on SQLState/vendor error codes.",
    "Connection eviction/removal and pool health management.",
    "Configuration to register the override implementation (likely HikariConfig property such as exceptionOverrideClassName).",
    "Error handling, retries, and connection validation/liveness checks within the pool."

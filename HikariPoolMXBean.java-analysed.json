  "ShortSummary": "JMX MBean interface for HikariCP pools exposing real-time metrics and control operations (eviction, suspend/resume).",
  "Summary": "Defines HikariPoolMXBean, a management/monitoring interface exposing point-in-time metrics (idle, active, total connections, and threads waiting) and control methods. Values are transient; sums may not match. softEvictConnections evicts idle connections now and marks active ones for eviction on return. suspendPool blocks DataSource#getConnection() indefinitely until resumePool is called, and suspension features require HikariConfig.allowPoolSuspension=true.",
  "MostImportantThings": [
    "Metrics methods: getIdleConnections, getActiveConnections, getTotalConnections, getThreadsAwaitingConnection (all are transient/point-in-time).",
    "Control methods: softEvictConnections, suspendPool, resumePool.",
    "Sum of idle + active may differ from total due to timing.",
    "suspendPool blocks DataSource#getConnection() with no timeout until resumePool.",
    "Pool suspension requires HikariConfig#setAllowPoolSuspension(true).",
    "softEvict evicts idle immediately and flags active for eviction upon return."

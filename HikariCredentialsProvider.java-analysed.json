  "ShortSummary": "An interface that lets HikariCP obtain username/password dynamically via a Credentials object.",
  "Summary": "HikariCredentialsProvider defines a single method, getCredentials(), to supply runtime-resolved credentials to HikariCP instead of hardcoding them. Implementations can fetch or generate credentials from external sources (e.g., secret managers) and return a com.zaxxer.hikari.util.Credentials containing username and password. Invocation timing/refresh behavior is not specified here and depends on the pool integration.",
  "MostImportantThings": [
    "It is an interface meant for dynamic credential provisioning at runtime.",
    "Single method: Credentials getCredentials().",
    "Returns com.zaxxer.hikari.util.Credentials (username/password container).",
    "Useful for secret rotation or external secret stores.",
    "Thread-safety and refresh cadence are not defined in this interface (likely determined by HikariCP usage)."

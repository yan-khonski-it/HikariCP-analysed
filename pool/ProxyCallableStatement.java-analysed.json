  "ShortSummary": "Abstract proxy wrapper for JDBC CallableStatement in HikariCP, extending ProxyPreparedStatement.",
  "Summary": "Defines a base class for proxying java.sql.CallableStatement instances. It ties a ProxyConnection to an underlying CallableStatement and delegates behavior via the parent ProxyPreparedStatement. No CallableStatement methods are overridden here; interception/management is likely handled in the superclass or generated subclasses.",
  "MostImportantThings": [
    "Extends ProxyPreparedStatement and implements CallableStatement.",
    "Constructor wires a ProxyConnection with an underlying CallableStatement.",
    "Contains no explicit overrides; behavior is inherited or provided by generated proxies.",
    "Purpose: enable interception/resource management for stored procedure calls within the pool."
